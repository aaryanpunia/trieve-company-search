# Trieve Company Search

I had a random dataset of companies lying around so I uploaded that to the Trieve API.

### Tech Stack Used

- React + Vite: I'm used to this frontend framework the most
- React Query: I love to state management ease this gives, just look at how little code I've had to write to manage retries and querying based on state changes.
- Shadcn/UI: Easy to setup UI library
- Tailwind: The best way to do css in my opinion

### Time Taken: 1 Hour
Most of the time was spent looking through trieve docs, rest was trivial.
